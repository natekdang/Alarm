C Program communicates with Microcontroller through serial port. 
During preset times (eg. noon) the program will send a serial "ON/OFF" 
to the microcontroller through the serial port. Microcontroller will read
the serial message and turn on the alarm. Current implementation does not
have microcontroller feedback (will be added down the line).
